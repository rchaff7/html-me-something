                    <h2>Diablo - 1996</h2>
                    <p>Remember when we met the Butcher down in the Catacombs of Tristram and he murdered us over and over?</p>
                    <p>Then everytime we would make it back to his room to pick up all our gold and items he would just murder us again?</p>
                    <p>Then eventually we got him stuck behind a gate and took him out with arrows?</p>
                    <p>Then we eventually made it down to Hell and defeated Diablo by running around screaming and on fire while my Golem distracted him?</p>
                    <p>Good times.</p>

                    <h2>Heroes of Might and Magic - 1995</h2>
                    <p>Remember when we found that Ghost Ship and thought it would be a great idea to plunder it which would be super easy?</p>
                    <p>Then it turned out it actually was full of Ghosts?</p>
                    <p>Then we figured out that Ghosts actually get stronger when they destroy a unit and have this snowball effect of becoming unstoppable?</p>
                    <p>Then we realized we were totally screwed and everyone died and became a ghost?</p>
                    <p>Good times.</p>

                    <h2>Gunstar Heroes - 1993</h2>
                    <p>Remember when we joined the Gunstars to get the Gems back from the Empire?</p>
                    <p>Then we had the weapons with multiple powerups to combine but Homing Star was easymode?</p>
                    <p>Then we rode the antigravity minecarts and had to fight SevenForce that turns into a bunch of different animals and ALSO A GUN?!?</p>
                    <p>Then we had to throw the giant person-sized dice and fight through a bunch of weird bosses to make it to the end of the boardgame which could also send you back to the starting point?</p>
                    <p>Good times.</p>

                    <h2>Streets of Rage 2 - 1992</h2>
                    <p>Remember when we were renegade cops who figured out that Mr. X was still alive and trying to take over the city with the Syndicate?</p>
                    <p>Then we had to go beat up that bartender behind his bar, and the guy with the jetpack on the bridge, and that weird Freddy Krueger dude with the claws in the theme park?</p>
                    <p>Then we kept going through the secret arena under the baseball stadium to fight the giant wressler dude, and ended up on a boat with the giant boxer guy?</p>
                    <p>Then we were on the beach and traveled to the facility guarded by exploding robots, and eventually made it to Mr. X's throne room where he shot us with his machine gun repeatedly?</p>
                    <p>Good times.</p>

                    <h2>Akalabeth - 1980</h2>
                    <p>Remember when we had to find the Balrog at the bottom of a dungeon somewhere in the World of Doom and slay it?</p>
                    <p>Then we wandered around the world and starved to death multiple times in the first hour since we couldnt find enough food or gold?</p>
                    <p>Then we had to draw our own maps by hand so we wouldnt get lost in the wireframes when we finally lived long enough to find a dungeon?</p>
                    <p>Then we hit a dead end in the dungeon with no where else to go, and the map we drew didn't make sense until we figured out that not all of the floors are connected to each other
                        because they are randomly generated, and we needed a special consumable in order to teleport up and down through the floor in order to progress?
